# MIDO
We have designed a medical imaging and diagnostic ontology that models a patients medical information as well as their ML predicted outcome Through our modeling of the components involved in the process of radiology report generation, we provide a means for system designers to translate their user requirements gathered from user studies to imaging reports that can be generated by their systems. We depict how our ontology schemacan support the modeling of chest x-ray report and outline how it can be used to further detect error in ML models.

## Ontology Modeling
The ontology developed can be found at: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MIDO

## Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
We use the chest ImaGenome data to instatiate out ontology, The data and the ruled used are available through valid credential access on Physionet.org
We have a sample kg for a patient in kg. The patient information has been retracted, and we only leave the model output in the KG. as the patient information requires access to the dataset.
